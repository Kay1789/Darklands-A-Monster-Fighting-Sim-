🐲 Console Monster RPG (C++ Game)

Welcome to my little console-based RPG game made entirely in **C++**!  
This is a simple turn-based system where you fight monsters, take damage, heal yourself, and test your logic skills while surviving the battle 👾

---

## 🔥 Features

- **Character Health System**  
  Health is broken down into 5 levels: KO, Critical, Injured, Slightly Injured, and Full Health.

- **Healing System with Limits**  
  You can only heal a few times, so think before you spam that potion 🧪

- **Monster Attacks**  
  There are 3 different monster attack types:  
  ➤ Constant damage  
  ➤ Random damage  
  ➤ Mixed damage (with a twist 😈)

- **Character Info Display**  
  Shows updated HP and health status before and after fights.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

- The game takes player input to confirm if they want to heal or not.
- Monster attacks are triggered randomly.
- Health conditions are updated dynamically after every turn.
- If your health hits 0, you're KO’d 💀

## 💡 What's Next?

I’m done with this version for now, but I might add new stuff later when I get more experience with C++.  
Maybe enemy variety, XP system, inventory, or even a full battle loop 👀

## ✨ Final Note

This project was part of my learning journey—getting used to object-oriented C++ and understanding how game logic is built.  
Thanks for checking it out 💖
